# Kruskal_Prim-Minimal-Spanning-Tree-Algorithm

Kruskal and Prim are two algorithms to find the Minimal Spanning Tree in a network. This repo contains code for implementation of Kruskal and Prim algorithms using Python. The algorithms were implemented on an open data and the results are shown in the ipython notebook
